\small 
ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case
Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of
the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as
hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or
imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his Queen or of
their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King's
Companion, or the King's eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife of the
King's eldest Son and Heir; or \textbf{if a Man do levy War against our Lord
the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King's Enemies in his
Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm\onslide<2>{\emph{,}} or elsewhere}, and
thereof be probably attainted of open Deed by the People of their
Condition: \dots And it is to be
understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged
Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty:
