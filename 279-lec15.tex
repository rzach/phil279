\item NB: $\sf \forall x\forall y\, A(x, y)$ true only if pairs $\langle \alpha, \alpha\rangle$ satisfy $\sf A(x, y)$
\item Does $\sf\forall x\forall y\, Adjoins(x, y)$ mean ``any \emph{two} objects adjoin each other''?
\item \dots true iff any pair $\langle\alpha, \beta\rangle$ satisfies $\sf Adjoins(x, y)$
\item \emph{including pairs where $\alpha = \beta$}
\item Hence, $\sf\forall x\forall y\, Adjoins(x, y)$ is \emph{always false} since no block adjoins itself!
\item Correct: $\sf \forall x\forall y(x \neq y \to Adjoins(x, y))$

\bits
\item $\sf \exists x\exists y\, A(x, y)$ \dots at least one pair $\langle \alpha,\beta\rangle$ satisfies A(x, y)
\item NB: $\sf \exists x\exists y\, A(x, y)$ is already true even if a single pair $\langle \alpha, \alpha\rangle$ satisfies $\sf A(x, y)$
\item Does $\sf\exists x\exists y\, SameRow(x, y)$ mean ``there are \emph{two} objects in the same row''?
\item \dots true iff at least one pair $\langle\alpha, \beta\rangle$ satisfies $\sf SameRow(x, y)$
\item \emph{including pairs where $\alpha = \beta$}
\item Hence, $\sf\exists x\exists y\, SameRow(x, y)$ is \emph{always true} since any block is in the same row as itself!

\subsec{Astell Taking Down Nicholls}{

'Tis true, thro' Want of Learning, and of that Superior Genius which
Men as Men lay claim to, she [the author] was ignorant of the
\textit{Natural Inferiority} of our Sex, which our Masters lay down as
a Self-Evident and Fundamental Truth. She saw nothing in the Reason of
Things, to make this either a Principle or a Conclusion, but much to
the contrary; it being Sedition at least, if not Treason to assert it
in this Reign. 

}
\subsec{Astell Taking Down Nicholls}{

For if by the Natural Superiority of their Sex, they
mean that \textit{every} Man is by Nature superior to \textit{every}
Woman, which is the obvious meaning, and that which must be stuck to
if they would speak Sense, it wou'd be a Sin in \textit{any} Woman to
have Dominion over \textit{any} Man, and the greatest Queen ought not
to command but to obey her Footman, because no Municipal Laws can
supersede or change the Law of Nature; so that if the Dominion of the
Men be such, the \textit{Salique Law,} as unjust as \textit{English
  Men} have ever thought it, ought to take place over all the Earth,
and the most glorious Reigns in the \textit{English, Danish,
  Castilian}, and other Annals, were wicked Violations of the Law of
Nature!
}
\subsec{Astell Taking Down Nicholls}{

If they mean that \textit{some} Men are superior to \textit{some}
Women this is no great Discovery; had they turn'd the Tables they
might have seen that \textit{some} Women are Superior to \textit{some}
Men. Or had they been pleased to remember their Oaths of Allegiance
and Supremacy, they might have known that \textit{One} Women is
superior to \textit{All} the Men in these Nations, or else they have
sworn to very little purpose. And it must not be suppos'd, that their
Reason and Religion wou'd suffer them to take Oaths, contrary to the
Laws of Nature and Reason of things.

\section{Translating Step-by-Step}

\subsec{Step-by-Step Method of Translation}{

\bit
\item What if your sentence contains more than one determiner phrase?
\item Deal with each DP separately
\item Think of DP as replaced with name or variable---result has one less DP
\item When you're down to one DP, apply known methods for single quantifiers
\item This results in wffs that express properties or relations, but themselves contain quantifiers
