\section{Quantifiers}

\subsec{Determiners in English}{

\bit
\item Articles: a, the
\item Cardinal numbers: zero, one, two, \dots
\item Quantifiers: all, few, many, several, some, every, each, any, no
\item either, neither, both
\item \dots
\eit

}


\subsec{Quantifiers in FOL}{

\bit
\item $\forall$: \emph{universal} quantifier, ``for all''
\[
\sf \forall x\, Cube(x)
\]
(Everything is a cube)
\item $\exists$: \emph{existential} quantifier, ``exists''
\[
\sf \exists y\, Large(y)
\]
(Something is large)
\eit

}

\subsec{Variables and Terms}{

\bit
\item Variables: $x$, $y$, $z$, $x_1$, $x_2$, \dots
\item Terms:
\bit
\item Constant symbols and variables are terms
\item If $f$ is an $n$-place function symbol, and $t_1$, \dots, $t_n$
are terms, then $f(t_1, \dots, t_n)$ is a term
\eit
\item Eg, in the language of arithmetic:
\[
1 \qquad x \qquad (1 + (x + y))
\]
\eit
}

\subsec{Well-Formed Formulas (wff's)}{

\bit
\item If $P$ is an $n$-place predicate symbol, and $t_1$, \dots, $t_n$
are terms, then $P(t_1, \dots, t_n)$ is an atomic wff
\item Every atomic wffs is a wff
\item If $P$ is a wff, so is $\lnot P$
\item If $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ are wffs, so are
\[
(P_1 \land {} \dots \land P_n) \text{ and }
(P_1 \lor {} \dots \lor P_n) 
\]
\item If $P$ and $Q$ are wffs, then so are
\[
(P \to Q) \text{ and } (P \iff Q)
\]
\item If $P$ is a wff and $x$ is a variable, then
\[
\forall x\, P \text{ and } \exists x\, P
\]
are wffs
\eit

}

\subsec{Examples}{

\bit
\item Atomic wffs: $\sf Cube(x)$, $\sf Larger(x, x)$, $\sf Larger(x, y)$, $\sf Larger(z, a)$, $\sf a = y$
\item $\sf Large(x) \land Cube(x)$
\item $\sf Large(x) \to (Cube(x) \land Larger(x, b))$ 
\item $\sf \forall x\, Cube(x)$
\item $\sf \exists x\, (Large(x) \land Cube(x))$ 
\item $\sf \exists y\, Cube(x)$
\item $\sf \forall x\, Cube(x) \land \forall x\, Large(x)$
\item $\sf \forall x\, (Cube(x) \land \forall x\, Large(x))$
\item $\sf \forall x\, Cube(x) \land Large(x)$
\eit 

}

\subsec{Scope and Binding}{

\[
\underline{\forall {\color{red}x}(Cube({\color{red}x}) \to (\underline{\exists {\color{blue}x}\, Smaller({\color{blue}x}, y)} \land \underline{\exists {\color{green}y}(Tet({\color{green}y}) \land Larger({\color{green}y}, {\color{red}x}))}))}
\]
\bits
\item The \emph{scope} of a quantifier extends till end of wff it precedes
\item Variables are \emph{bound} by the nearest matching quantifier to the left in whose scope they are
\item Variables not bound are \emph{free}
\item A \emph{sentence} is a wff with no free variables
\eit
}

\section{Semantics of Quantifiers and Variables}

\subsec{Possible Worlds and First-order Structure}{

\bit
\item Collection of objects (\emph{domain}, not empty)
\item Referents for each individual constant (which object it names)
\item Properties of each object (shape, size, position on board)
  \bit\item Extension of each 1-place predicate symbol: collection of
  objects it applies to\eit
\item Relations of each pair of objects (larger, same row,
  etc)\bit\item Extension of each $n$-place predicate symbol: tuple of
  objects standing in the relation
 \eit\eit

}

% Redo this -- motivate by ``\forall x Cube(x)'' should say ``everything is a cube'' -- but what if it's more complicated than just''Cube(x)''?  Less abstract at the beginning!

\subsec{Truth of Sentences}{

\bit
\item Suppose $P(x)$ contains only $x$ free 
\item Suppose $n$ is a new constant symbol not occurring in $P(x)$
\item Let $P(n)$ be $P(x)$ with all free occurrences of $x$ replaced by $n$
\item $\forall x\, P(x)$ is true in a world $W$ iff for every $\alpha$ among the objects in $W$, $P(n)$ is true in the world $W_\alpha$ which is just like $W$ except $n$ names $\alpha$
\item $\exists x\, P(x)$ is true in a world $W$ iff for at least one $\alpha$ among the objects in $W$, $P(n)$ is true in the world $W_\alpha$ which is just like $W$ except $n$ names $\alpha$
\eit

}


\subsec{Satisfaction}{

\bit 
\item Define relation of \emph{satisfaction} between an object $\alpha$,
a wff with one free variable $P(x)$, and a world~$W$\\
``$\alpha$ satisfies $P(x)$''
\item  \emph{$\alpha$ satisfies $P(x)$ in~$W$} iff $P(n)$ is true in the world~$W'$ which is just like $W$ except $n$ names $\alpha$
\item $P(x)$ defines a property in the world~$W$: the collection of all the objects $\alpha$ that satisfy $P(x)$
\item{} [More general: \emph{$\langle\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k\rangle$
  satisfies $P(x_1, \dots, x_k)$ in $W$} iff $P(n_1, \dots, n_k)$ is
  true in $W'$ which is like $W$ except $n_i$ names $\alpha_i$ ($i =
  1, \dots, k$)]
\item $P(x_1, \dots, x_k)$ defines a $k$-place relation
\eit

\subsec{Satisfaction and Expressing Properties and Relations}{

\bit
\item $\sf Large(x) \land Cube(x)$ \dots ``$x$ is a large cube''
\item $\sf LeftOf(x, a) \lor RightOf(x, a)$ \dots ``$x$ is left of or right of a''; ``$x$ is to the side of a''
\item More than one way to express a property:
\bit
\item $\sf LeftOf(a, x) \lor RightOf(a, x)$
\item $\sf LeftOf(x, a) \lor LeftOf(a, x)$
\item $\sf \lnot SameCol(x, a)$
