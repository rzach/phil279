\section{What is Logic?}

\subsec{What is Logic?}{

\bit
\item \emph{Logic is the science of what follows from what.}
\item Valid and invalid inference
\bit
\item Socrates is human. All humans are mortal.\\ 
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
\item Socrates is human. All Greeks are human.\\ 
Therefore, Socrates is Greek.
\eit
\item Logic investigates what makes the first inference \emph{valid} and the
  second \emph{invalid}.
  \eit }



\subsec{What is Formal Logic?}{

\bit
\item Studies logical properties of formal languages (not English)
\bit
\item Logical consequence (what follows from what?)
\item Logical consistency (when do sentences contradict one another?)
\eit
\item Expressive power (what can be expressed in a given formal
  language, and how?)
\item Formal models (mathematical structures described by formal language)
\item Inference and proof systems (how can it be proved that something
  follows from something else?)
\item (Metalogical properties of logical systems)
\eit 
}

\subsec{What is Logic Good For? (Philosophy)}{

\bit
\item (Informal) logic originates in philosophy (Aristotle)
\item Valid inference cornerstone of philosophical research
\item Logic itself a subdiscipline of philosophy
\item Formal tools of logic useful to make intuitive
philosophical notions precise
\bit

\item Time
\item Moral obligation and permissibility
\item Belief and knowledge
\eit
\eit

}

\subsec{What is Logic Good For? (Mathematics)}{

\bit
\item Formal logic developed in the quest for foundations of mathematics (19th C.)
\item Logical systems provide precise foundational framework for mathematics
\bit
\item Axiomatic systems (e.g, geometry)
\item Algebraic structures (e.g., groups)
\item Set theory (e.g, Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice)
\eit
\item Formal methods make mathematics more precise
\bit
\item Formal language can make mathematical claims more precise
\item Formal structures can point to alternatives, unveil gaps in proofs
\item Formal proof systems make proofs rigorous
\item Formal proofs make mechanical \emph{proof checking} and \emph{proof search} possible
\eit
\item Logical tools can be applied to mathematical problems
\eit

}


\subsec{What is Logic Good For? (Computer Science)}{

\bit
\item Combinational logic circuits
\item Database query languages
\item Logic programming
\item Knowledge representation
\item Automated reasoning
\item Formal specification and verification (of programs, of hardware designs)
\item Theoretical computer science (theory of computational
  complexity, semantics of programming languages)
 \eit

}

\section{The Formal Language(s) of FOL}

\subsec{Functions of Language}{

\bit
\item Pick out objects in the ``world'' 
\item Say things about these objects
\item Different categories of words play different roles
\bit
\item Names (``Alice''), pronouns (``she''), demonstratives
  (``this''), certain phrases (``the Queen of England in 2011''):\\ pick
  out things (``singular terms'')
\item Verbs, adjectives, common nouns (in combination with other
  words): \\ used to say things about the objects picked out by singular
  terms
 \eit 
\item \emph{Predicating:} ascribing a property or relation to object(s)
\eit

}

\subsec{Simple Examples of Predication}{

\bit
\item Name + ``is'' + adjective\\
``Mars is red''\\
``Jupiter is large''
\item Name + ``is'' + comparative + ``than'' + Name\\
``Mars is smaller than Jupiter'' 
\item Name + ``is a''  + common noun\\
``Venus is a planet''
\item Name + verb (+ Name)
``The Earth moves''\\
``Phobos orbits Mars''\\
\eit

}

\subsec{First-order Languages}{

\bit
\item \emph{Individual constants} pick out things
\[
\sf a, b, c, \dots, mars, jupiter, \dots
\]
\item \emph{Predicate symbols} express properties and relations
\[
\sf Red, Large, Larger, Planet, Orbits, \le, =, \dots
\]
\item To say something about something, combine predicate symbols
  andindividual constants
\[
\sf Red(mars), Planet(mars),
Orbits(phobos, mars),
a = b
\]
(atomic sentences)
\eit
