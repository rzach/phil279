\subsec{Logical Consequence}{

\bit
\item $C$ is a \emph{logical consequence} of $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ iff $C$ is true in every possible world in which $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ are all true together 
\item NB: This does \emph{not} say that $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ and $C$
  have to be true in every possible world (or even one)! 
\item $C$ is a logical consequence of $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ iff there is no possible world in which $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ are all true together while $C$ is false
\item $C$ is \emph{not} a \emph{consequence} of $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ iff there is a world in which $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ are all true but $C$ is false.

\subsec{Validity}{

\bit
\item An argument is \emph{logically valid} iff its conclusion is true in every possible world in which the premises are all true 
\item An argument is \emph{logically invalid} iff there is a world in which its premises all true but its conclusion is false.\\[2ex]
\item Determine invalidity by finding a possible world in which premises are true and conclusion is false.
\item No such world can be found: argument is (probably) valid
\item To establish validity, give a proof

\subsec{Soundness}{

\bit
\item An argument is \emph{sound} (with respect to a given world) iff it is valid \emph{and} its premises are true in the world
\item An argument is \emph{unsound} (with respect to a given world) iff it is invalid \emph{or} at least one premise is false in the world (or both)

\subsec{Symmetric Predicates}{

\bits
\item $P(\_,\_)$ is \emph{symmetric} iff: whenever $P(a, b)$ is true, $P(b, a)$ is also true, and vice versa
\item $=$, SameSize, SameShape, SameCol, SameRow
\item Adjoins
\item Extensions of symmetric predicates:

\subsec{Transitive Predicates}{

\subsec{Inverse Predicates}{

\bits
\item $P(\_,\_)$ and $Q(\_, \_)$ are \emph{inverses} iff: whenever $P(a, b)$ is true, $Q(b, a)$ is also true, and vice versa
\item $=$, SameSize, SameShape, SameCol, SameRow, Adjoins are inverses of themselves
\item Larger---Smaller, LeftOf---RightOf, FrontOf---BackOf

\subsec{Indiscernibility of Identicals}{

If $P(a)$ is true, and $a = b$ is also true, then $P(b)$ is true

\section{Informal Proofs}

\subsec{Proofs}{

\begin{block}{Definition}

A \emph{proof} of conclusion $C$ from premises $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ is
a demonstration that $C$ is a consequence of $P_1$, \dots, $P_n$ which
\bit
\item proceeds \emph{step-by-step}
\item each step is \emph{justified}
\item is \emph{rigorous} (no gaps)

\bit
\item Informal proofs in English
\item Formal proofs

\item using system Fitch, 
\item steps justified by \emph{inference rules}

\subsec{Example}{

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{3cm}
\fitcharg{\formula{LeftOf(a, b)} \\
\formula{RightOf(c, d)}\\
\formula{b = d}}{\formula{LeftOf(a, c)}}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{7cm}
\bens
\item We are told that $c$ is right of $d$ (premise 2)
\item We are told that $b$ is identical to $d$ (premise 3)
\item Thus, $c$ is right of $b$ (from 1, 2, by the
  indiscernibility of identicals)
\item So $b$ is left of $c$ (from 3, as ``left of'' and ``right of'' are inverses) 
\item We are told that $a$ is left of $b$ (premise 1)
\item So $a$ is left of $c$ (from 5, 4 as ``left of'' is transitive)\\
