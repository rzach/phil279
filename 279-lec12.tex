\section{Review}

\subsec{Satisfaction}{

\bit 
\item Atomic wffs like $\sf Cube(x)$ express the properties we've
  assigned to the predicate symbol
\item More general: any wff $\sf P(x)$ expresses a property
\item Which one? The property of \emph{satisfying $\sf P(x)$}.
\item \emph{$\alpha$ satisfies $\sf P(x)$ in~$W$} iff $\sf P(n)$ is true in
  the world~$W'$ which is just like $W$ except $n$ names $\alpha$
\item Extension of $\sf P(x)$ in $W$: set of all objects that satisfy
  $\sf P(x)$ in $W$.
\item Examples:
\bit
\item $x$ is a small tetrahedron to the left of $b$:\[
\sf Small(x) \land Tet(x) \land LeftOf(x, b)
\]
\item $x$ adjoins  c or d, but not both
\[
\sf \lnot(Adjoins(x, c) \iff Adjoins(x, d))
\]

\subsec{Quantifiers and Satisfaction: $\forall$}{

\bit
\item The sentence
\[\sf
\forall x\, P(x)
\]
says (is true iff) 
\bit
\item every object in the domain (= world) satisfies P(x)
\item P(n) is true for \emph{whatever} object is named by~n
\item extension of P(x) in $W$ is the entire domain
\eit
\eit
}

\subsec{Quantifiers and Satisfaction: $\exists$}{

\bit
\item The sentence
\[\sf
\exists x\, P(x)
\]
says (is true iff) 
\bit
\item at least one object in the domain satisfies P(x)
\item P(n) is true for \emph{at least one} object named by~n
\item extension of P(x) in $W$ is not empty

\subsec{Expressing ``Everything'', ``Something''}{


\bit
\item ``Everything is a large cube''
\[ \sf \forall x(Large(x) \land Cube(x)) \]
\item ``Something is a large cube''
\[ \sf \exists x(Large(x) \land Cube(x)) \]
\eit
}

\subsec{Expressing ``Nothing'', ``Not Everything''}{

\bit\item ``Nothing is a large cube'' \pause
\begin{align*}
& \sf \forall x\,\lnot(Large(x) \land Cube(x)) \\
& \sf \lnot\exists x(Large(x) \land Cube(x))
\end{align*}
Also: ``Everything is: not a large cube''
\item ``Something isn't a large cube'' \pause
\begin{align*}
& \sf \exists x\,\lnot(Large(x) \land Cube(x)) \\

\section{Restricted Quantification}

\subsec{Determiner Phrases}{

\bit
\item Determiners combine with noun phrases to make determiner phrases (DP):
\bit
\item ``\emph{A} large terahedron''

\item ``\emph{Some} cube(s) between d and e''
\item ``\emph{Most} philosophy majors''
\item ``\emph{Both} small cubes''
\eit
\eit
}

\subsec{Determiner Phrases in Sentences}{

\bit
\item DPs make subjects of sentence, just like names/constants and coordination constructions of them do
\bit
\item ``\emph{Claire and Alex} study logic''---``\emph{Most philosophy majors} study logic''
\item ``\emph{2} is prime''---``\emph{Some even number} is prime''
\item ``\emph{a} is between b and c''---``\emph{Every large cube} is between b and c''
\eit
\item We know how to translate the former---how do we deal with the latter?
\eit
}

\subsec{Restricted Quantification}{

\bit
\item ``Det A is/are B''
\item A is a noun (phrase), B an adjective or article + noun (phrase)
\item Translate ``x is an A'' into a wff of FOL: A(x)
\item Translate ``x is B''  into a wff of FOL: B(x)

\subsec{Existential Import}{

\bit
\item Does ``all cubes are small'' have ``there are cubes'' as a consequence?
\item Not according to our translations!
\[
\sf\forall x(Cube(x) \to Small(x))
\]
is true if there are no cubes at all.
\item (1) ``Everyone who took the exam passed''\\
(2) ``Noone who took the exam failed''
\bit
\item (1) and (2) are equivalent
\item If noone took the exam, then (2) is true 
\eit

\subsec{Existential Import and Implicature}{

\bit
\item P \emph{implies} Q iff Q is a consequence of P 
\item If P implies Q, then the denial of Q contradicts P

\item ``Some cubes are small'' implies ``There are cubes''
\item ``Some cubes are small. There are no cubes'': contradictory

\subsec{Existential Import and Implicature}{

\bit
\item P \emph{implicates} Q if in asserting P, it is (strongly) suggested that Q is true 
\item Existential import is only \emph{implicated}, not \emph{implied}
\item Test: No contradiction if implicature is denied:
\bit

\item ``Noone who took the exam failed.\\
In fact, noone took the exam at all''

In fact, all students passed.''

All zero of them.''
